ChatGPT uses server sent event to get stream message model response. This will consume in the frontend with ReadableStream to get typing style response on web UI elements.

every message from user and model get a message id

and every conversation have conversation id

there may be improvement to use ulid instead of uuid in the message id (since message is time-series)

They have very simple, neat but effective API design, for example, the conversation/feedback

Interesting thing is, whenever you add a follow up chat, every request message have message id and it's parent message it (the message before it). That's how chatGPT manage context by API design.
