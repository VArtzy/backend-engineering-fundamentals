HTTP3 uses QUIC which is different protocol than HTTP2 (using TCP)

QUIC is using UDP (HTTP3 => QUIC => UDP)

This effectively terminate TCP's limitations (example: TCP head of Line Block) when a segment lost, the next segments will not send and acknowledge to the client
t

Merge connection setup + tls in one handshake (lower latency, roundtrip)

Having connection migration

HTTP2 and HTTP3 may be similiar (stream based, one connection) but it is not built upon (just similiar)

Having slightly better header compression algorithms

Since use UDP, IP Segment will not handled in QUIC, so it has to send big quicgram (datagram)

HTTP3 eats more CPU than HTTP2 (more processes on going)
