HTTP 1.1 only do one request for one connection, this make it slower

HTTP 2 based on stream, it can multiplexing request on connection (save resource)

HTTP 2 also make compression, secured by default (using tls) use binary format which HTTP 1.1 doesn't

Definitely faster than HTTP1.1 in terms of performance

TCP head of Line Block => when a segment lost, the next segments will not send and acknowledge to the client

HTTP2 eats more CPU than HTTP1.1 (more processes on going)
