Connection is effectively socket, have a file descriptor. A way to send buffer, stream, segment, packet and datagram through communication (socket is actually just a integer under the hood (in C))

Sockets are uniquely identified by a combination of an IP address and a port number. 

it is 'listening' socket from server perspective

it is 'connection' socket from client perspective

Once connected, data can be exchanged between the two sockets using functions like send and receive.
