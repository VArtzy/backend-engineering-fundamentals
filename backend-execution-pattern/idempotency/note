Idempotentcy is the idea of repeatable request but without change the state in the backend

GET is actually idempotent by default (browser and proxy), derived from read operation. No matter how many request send, the response will not change any state

POST are not idempotent default, but we can make it idempotent on application layer

ways:
- Request ID
- Upsert (Update the same data instead of insert it again)
- Idempotent token/key
- Stateless system
