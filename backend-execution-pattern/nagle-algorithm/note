low level algorithm that in OS or transport layer that use MSS (Minimum Segment Size) to pool buffer at certain threshold before sending it. Send the remaining data after getting ACK.

if we have 5000b buffer
say the MSS is 1500b
first 1500 sended
second 1500 sended
third 1500 sended
the 500 will not send until it getting ack from sended segment before

this lead to delay

pro: save bandwidth
cons: delay and more latency (especially when it's stacked, it's add up)

so in most cases better to turn in off (like curl turn off using  --TCP-NODELAY)
